                <p>How might I design a mobile app that empowers people to learn new vocabulary on the go for quick study sessions?</p>

                <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
                <p>By creating an app that teaches words in context, builds on learned vocabulary, gauges growth, and connects users, I will see an increase in users' vocabulary.</p>

                <img src="img/Vocabulary-logo.png" alt="Vocabulary Logo" class="center">
                <p>Vocabulary is a well-rounded, easy-to-use app with more positive than negative features. The goal is to learn new vocabulary words, which is met as they give the users new words with reminders as often as they may prefer. The user may also scroll down and learn word after the other without dedicated study time. The UX and UI sides of the design are clearly taken into action with an easy-to-use app that is beautifully created to draw users in and keep them engaged with reminders and customization.
                </p>

                <img src="img/Vocab-Junkie-logo.png" alt="Vocab Junkie Logo" class="center">
                <p>Vocab Junkie works and is successful, as users can learn new vocabulary words from it. However, users will not use this app for extended periods of time. The designers did create different modes and success tracking, which is enticing but failed to make it appealing to the eye and bank accounts. With $4.99 for each set, most users would feel too much friction to continue and just move on to another app. Vocab Junkie only scratches the surface of UX design and lacks UI design throughout. Desirability is missing, and there are not many thoughts or feelings that arise as users accomplish their goals.
                </p>

                <img src="img/Atlas-English-logo.png" alt="Atlas English Logo" class="center">
                <p>Atlas English is a very successful product. It meets the user's goals and keeps them engaged by offering more levels of vocabulary knowledge. The designers were able to take the users' needs and find an easy-to-use solution that users could use for an extended period of time. This app exceeds the goals of user experience and user interface design, as it is useful, usable, and desirable. The users' learning is proven by passing each quiz, test, and exam, which encourages users to continue using the app and expanding their vocabulary.

                        <li>"I need to know the word and what it means first and then apply it."</li>

                        <li>"I believe that if my mom and I would use the same vocabulary app and I could see how many times she has used her new words in a week and she could see mine, then that would create a sense of competition and encourage me to continue using the app."</li>
                        <li>"I believe that if there is some sort of fun aspect at the end of all the work, that would keep me motivated to continue."</li>
                        <li>"I think a good way would be seeing a new word each day and then building from the previous days as you move through that week."</li>
                        <li>"I believe I would also think about it more if it was social and you could use it with your friends."</li>
                    </ul>

                    <b>Feeling</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"I feel like a lot of apps do a good job of gamifying, but for me, if I can see my strengths and weaknesses and could target my weaknesses, then I would be more likely to continue using the app."</li>
                        <li>"I personally feel like I have a hard time with words."</li>
                        <li>"I feel like a lot of apps lack in showing progress."</li>
                        <li>"I feel like I am more engaged if there are building blocks that slowly get harder."</li>

                            Anna needs a way to expand her vocabulary, retain it and stay motivated because she wants to feel more confident when speaking to new clients and needs to improve the storytelling aspect of her job so that she can continue to grow in her career path.

                    <p>Hi, ______. My name is Andrea Nunley, and I will walk you through this session today. I am conducting usability tests to better evaluate how well my prototype empowers people to learn new vocabulary. The session should take approximately 10 - 15 minutes. This is not a test. You can’t do or say anything wrong here. You will be testing an incomplete prototype that likely has errors and mistakes - that’s why we’re testing it out! As you use the prototype, I will ask you as much as possible to think aloud: to say what you’re looking at, what you’re trying to do, and what you’re thinking. If you have any questions as we go along, ask them. I may not be able to answer them right away since we’re interested in how people do when they don’t have someone sitting next to them to help, but I will answer any non-prototype flow-related questions. All right, let's do this!

                        <li>You are looking around the app and come across the word of the day. You remember a person when you read the definition. Add that note to the word of the day.</li>
                        <li>You are enjoying the app and want to try to beat your friends in the weekly quizzes. You ask one of your friends to download and create an account so you can add them as a friend in the app. Add your friend to the app.</li>
                        <li>You remember a word you don't know the meaning of but want to learn and remember it. Add a new stack for words you are unsure about in books and add the new word to it.</li>
                        <li>You want to practice the words of the week to improve your quiz score. Review this week's stack as flashcards.</li>

                              <p>Added a new menu icon throughout the whole app to have the ability to add a word from anywhere, and moved the quiz of the week to under the "Train Your Brain" screen to create space for the new menu icon to add words and stacks more efficiently and quicker.</p>

                  <p>Through the user-centered designing of this vocabulary application, I was able to define our user, their goals, and pain points and design and test a solution to their need.</p>
             </div> 

              <div>
                  <h3><b>01 User Interface Design</b></h3>
                  <p>The first next step is to develop an interface design. I will begin with researching colors to evoke the right emotions and begin developing a design system to implement as I design a high-definition prototype.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h3><b>02 Engagement Improvements</b></h3>
                  <p>I plan to increase the rewarding aspects of the app to increase user engagement and retention. I will do this by implementing a share-with-friends component after each weekly quiz where users can share their accomplishments directly to social media to showcase their score and invite others to join. I will also increase the number of badges users can achieve to keep users engaged while using the app.</p>
              </div>

              <div>
              <h3><b>03 User Testing</b></h3>
              <p>I will test each decision and prototype during and after each design decision and new iteration to confirm alignment with the user goals.</p>
