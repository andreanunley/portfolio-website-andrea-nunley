                <p>How might I design a mobile app that empowers people to learn new vocabulary on the go for quick study sessions?</p>

                <br>
                <h3><b>Hypothesis</b></h3>
                <p>By creating an app that teaches words in context, builds on learned vocabulary, gauges growth, and connects users, I will see an increase in users' vocabulary.</p>

                <img src="img/Vocabulary-logo.png">
                <p>Vocabulary is a well-rounded, easy-to-use app with more positive than negative features. The goal is to learn new vocabulary words, which is met as they give the users new words with reminders as often as they may prefer. The user may also scroll down and learn word after the other without dedicated study time. The UX and UI sides of the design are clearly taken into action with an easy-to-use app that is beautifully created to draw users in and keep them engaged with reminders and customization.
                </p>

                <img src="img/Vocab-Junkie-logo.png">
                <p>Vocab Junkie works and is successful, as users can learn new vocabulary words from it. However, users will not use this app for extended periods of time. The designers did create different modes and success tracking, which is enticing but failed to make it appealing to the eye and bank accounts. With $4.99 for each set, most users would feel too much friction to continue and just move on to another app. Vocab Junkie only scratches the surface of UX design and lacks UI design throughout. Desirability is missing, and there are not many thoughts or feelings that arise as users accomplish their goals.
                </p>

                <img src="img/Atlas-English-logo.png">
                <p>Atlas English is a very successful product. It meets the user's goals and keeps them engaged by offering more levels of vocabulary knowledge. The designers were able to take the users' needs and find an easy-to-use solution that users could use for an extended period of time. This app exceeds the goals of user experience and user interface design, as it is useful, usable, and desirable. The users' learning is proven by passing each quiz, test, and exam, which encourages users to continue using the app and expanding their vocabulary.

                        <li>"I feel like a lot of apps do a good job of gamifying, but for me, if I can see my strengths and weaknesses and could target my weaknesses, then I would be more likely to continue using the app."</li>
                        <li>"I personally feel like I have a hard time with words."</li>
                        <li>"I feel like a lot of apps lack in showing progress."</li>

                            Anna needs a way to expand her vocabulary, retain it and stay motivated because she wants to feel more confident when speaking to new clients and needs to improve the storytelling aspect of her job so that she can continue to grow in her career path.

                    <p>Hi, ______. My name is Andrea Nunley, and I will walk you through this session today. I am conducting usability tests to better evaluate how well my prototype empowers people to learn new vocabulary. The session should take approximately 10 - 15 minutes. This is not a test. You can’t do or say anything wrong here. You will be testing an incomplete prototype that likely has errors and mistakes - that’s why we’re testing it out! As you use the prototype, I will ask you as much as possible to think aloud: to say what you’re looking at, what you’re trying to do, and what you’re thinking. If you have any questions as we go along, ask them. I may not be able to answer them right away since we’re interested in how people do when they don’t have someone sitting next to them to help, but I will answer any non-prototype flow-related questions. All right, let's do this!
                    </p>

I will do this by implementing a share-with-friends component after each weekly quiz where users can share their accomplishments directly to social media to showcase their score and invite others to join.
